Hi all I'm John Sullivan, welcome to my depository.

I have recently completed a Higher Diploma in Software Development from Atlantic Technological University and I am now currently looking for work in the IT industry.
For my course I have completed 2 main projects the Polybius Encryption and Sentiment Analysis using Virtual Threads. Both these projects have pinned to my profile 
for viewing. These 2 projects are written in Java, which was the main area of study for my course.

I also studied other langusges and frameworks inlcuding node.js, typescript, javascript, angular/ionic and SQL databases. I have pinned my Ionic application to my 
repository.

I am looking for work in a software development role to develop my skills further.
